# R Toolbox to apply unsupervised learning methods with R

## Background
This is a taks from the module "Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling II" of the [Master of Applied Information and Data Science](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-business/degree-programmes/master/applied-information-and-data-science/) at Hochschule Luzern.

## Goal
- offer R Toolbox to apply different unsupervised machine learning algorithms that work with almost any input datasets
- how to use these machine learning algorithms
- how to interprete the results, supported with our wine data set example


## Results
- main file (name to be defined): Shows the [following methods](https://www.evernote.com/l/Ai9WPKBaEfFEzqgLvlABkPvsZA7qA0CgPjI) with a wine dataset as example. One can find the purpose, advantages and disadvantages of each method. Additionally there are some possible interpretations for the given dataset. 
- Shiny widget for k-means (exploring_dataset_with_shiny_widget_k_means): One can explore the wine dataset interactively with this application. 


## Outlook
We are developing a R Toolbox to apply different unsupervised machine learning algorithms that work with almost any input datasets.
