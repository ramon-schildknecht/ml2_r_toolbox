# R Toolbox to apply unsupervised learning methods with R

## Background
This is a taks from the module "Applied Machine Learning and Predictive Modelling II" of the [Master of Applied Information and Data Science](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-business/degree-programmes/master/applied-information-and-data-science/) at Hochschule Luzern.


## Autors
to be defined


## Outlook
We are developing a R Toolbox to apply different unsupervised machine learning algoriths that work with almost any input datasets.
